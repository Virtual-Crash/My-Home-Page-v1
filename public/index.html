<h3> The day i had the most fun</h3>

<p>The day i had the most fun was when i said yes to every whim.
My friends and i hid Easter eggs in a graveyard on a sunny Tuesday,
got lost in the woods and found a family of kind deer. We listened to our
favorite songs and sang as loud as we could. Nothing could ever top great
friends and wild adventures.</p>
